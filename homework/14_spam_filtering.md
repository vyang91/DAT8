## Class 14 Pre-work: Spam Filtering

Read Paul Graham's [A Plan for Spam](http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html).

Here are some questions to think about:

- Should a spam filter optimize for sensitivity or specificity, in Paul's opinion?
- Before he tried the "statistical approach" to spam filtering, what was his approach?
- What are the key components of his statistical filtering system? In other words, how does it work?
- What did Paul say were some of the benefits of the statistical approach?
- How good was his prediction of the "spam of the future"?
