# Project question and dataset
* Can I predict weekly fantasy QB scores using historical stats and Las Vegas odds?
* I plan on using weekly game data and historical closing odds dating back to 2009.

* The weekly game data comes in a seemingly robust and well-built python module. The NFL odds will need to be scraped, but the data seems clean otherwise. There may be better sources available for historical odds.
* Sports are a known treasure trove of data. The recent rise in popularity of daily fantasy leagues and the ever-prevalent sports betting world present a potentially massive financial opportunity for data science and machine learning applications. Besides the financial incentive, I've been an avid fantasy sports player for the better part of a decade now and have always wanted to try and find patterns or even answers in an untapped world of numbers.
* If time permits, I'd like to compare my projections vs. Yahoo's or ESPN's (the two major fantasy sites). Scraping their weekly historical projections may prove challenging.
