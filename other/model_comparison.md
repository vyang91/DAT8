# Comparison of Machine Learning Models

## K-nearest neighbors (KNN)

**Advantages:**

- Simple to understand and explain
- Model training is fast
- Can be used for classification and regression

**Disadvantages:**

- Must store all of the training data
- Prediction phase can be slow when n is large
- Sensitive to irrelevant features
- Sensitive to the scale of the data
- Accuracy is (generally) not competitive with the best supervised learning methods
